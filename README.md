# Heart-diagnosis
Cardiovascular disease(CVD) are often operated efficaciously with an amalgamation of lifestyle changes,
medicine and, in some instances, surgery. With the proper treatment, the symptoms of
heart condition are often lessened and therefore the working of the heart is improved.
The predicted results can be used to prevent this and thus reducing cost for surgery and
other expensive.

The main objective of this project is to prognosticate the accuracy of various models
for CVD prediction system and then categorize the evaluation of all the models to
select the best one for our problem. The system can extract useful insights and
discover hidden patterns from the dataset to get a more accurate diagnosis and
decision making. CVD prognosis system aims to make use of various robust machine
learning and data mining techniques to foretell the people who are in the similitude of
getting the cardiac disease at an accurate time to provide affordable services and save
precious lives.
